The Iris rover, developed by students at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), designed to demonstrate the capabilities of small, lightweight robotic systems on the Moon. Its mission includes capturing scientific images of the lunar terrain and testing new localization techniques.

In January 2024, Iris was launched aboard Astrobotic's Peregrine Lunar Lander. However, an anomaly with the lander prevented a successful soft landing on the lunar surface. Despite this setback, the Iris team utilized the opportunity to gather valuable data during the mission, contributing to future lunar exploration endeavors.
