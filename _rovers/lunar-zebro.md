Lunar Zebro is a lunar rover project developed by students at Delft University of Technology as part of the Zebro program. This small, autonomous rover is designed to demonstrate advanced navigation and self-reliance on the harsh lunar surface.

The rover will explore the lunar surface around its lander, capturing images to study the effects of traditional landing methods on the lunar surface. This research aims to improve future mission planning and assess environmental impact. After completing its main mission, the rover will attempt to travel as far as possible to test the durability of its systems.
